`RINATO GAMES!!!`

To create is a passionate fire that is never extinguished. 

 My passion lies within computer science. I have had the honor of working with some wonderful people both as after school work study
 (Perfect Memory) and internships (Evolve I.P.) during my time at the Downingtown S.T.E.M Academy. During my college career, I was invited
 back to Evolve IP under a college internship program and I am currently involved in an internship during my Honors coursework at YouROK.
 My career goal is to take my passion and love for computer science and help make the world more connected and to give those without some
 of the same opportunities I have been blessed with in my life.

I am currently attending the University of Utah in their computer science program in their video game development tack. I am specifically 
focus on tools and rendering/graphics programming. Some of my coursework includes:
* Interactive Computer Graphics (CS 5610)
* Traditional Game Development (EAE 3710)
* Alternative Game Development (EAE 3720)
